- 👋 Hi, I’m @jcardenas-cl lead developer at Laika, a small agency located on Chile. With almost 10 years of experience of php and WordPress theme development. 
- 👀 I’m interested in learn new things, not only developing languages, also photography and music. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning react js and a bit of UX design. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects, not only on bugfixes or features, I'm happy to translate to Spanish too.
